					<h1>Let Me Tell You a Story</h1>
					<p>It’s a boring one, so bear with me. I was born and raised in Waterloo, Ontario Canada by two South African parents. My four South African brothers are to blame for my personality. It’s been my dream to design for as long as I can remember. My love for design is rooted in typography. It is for this reason that Alexey Brodovitch’s work is immensely influential to my design style.</p>
					<p>“Brodovitch believed that type and photographs are equal in their power. A single letter magnified to the size of a page is just as provocative and inspiring as a photo of a model wearing the latest fashions.”</p>

					<h1>Web Design Studio</h1>
					<p>My favourite design studio is Quarry Integrated Communications. They offer more services than just web design, but I had the unique opportunity of working with their digital team over the summer and I’m truly impressed with both their quality of work, and the way they do business. There is no lack of integrity and they’re always trying to find the best solution for their client, even if it means less money for them.</p>
